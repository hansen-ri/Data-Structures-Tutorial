# Stacks
### Last In, First Out
Last in First out is the principle of Stacks, not dissimilar from the idea of a "stack" of any physically and vertically stackable objects (ex: books, pancakes, etc). Consequently, the first item to picked up from the pile/stack would have been the last one added. 

### Common Operations
Considering the format of the stack structure, the built-in Python list operations "Push" and "Pop" are used to add and remove data from the list, respectively.
